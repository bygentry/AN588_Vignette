## Notes
LDA is linear discriminate analysis. It is a type of analysis that is used to predict a data point based on other features. LDA works by calculating the means and covariance matrices for each data class. Linear discrimiante analysis utilized pattern recognition in order to predict a specific data point. LDA effectively reduces the amount of data dimensions.

## Challenge 1
use linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to analyze the gibbon femur data and predict the sex of gibbons by species and femur length

## Challenge 2
use LFA to predict the age class of gibbons based on their species and femur length

## Challenge 3
use quadratic discriminant analysis to predict the family of a primate based on several data points from the Kamilar and Cooper data 
predictors:
- mean brain size
- mean mass for males and females
- mass dimorphism ratio
- canine dimophism ratio
