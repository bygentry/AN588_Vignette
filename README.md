## Notes

## Challenge 1
use discriminant function analysis (DFA) to analyze the gibbon femur data and predict the sex of gibbons by species and femur length

## Challenge 2
use DFA to predict the age class of gibbons based on their species and femur length

## Challenge 3
use DFA to predict the family of a primate based on several data points from the Kamilar and Cooper data 
predictors:
- mean brain size
- mean mass for males and females
- mass dimorphism ratio
- canine dimophism ratio
